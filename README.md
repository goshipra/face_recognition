# face_recognition

# I used Support Vector Machine and Principal component analysis Algorithms to recognize faces from a Olliveti Dataset

#Objective: To classify the faces of the 10 different person  with 10 different images. I built a facial recognition model using PCA and SVM.
The Principal Component Analysis algorithm was used to reduce the dimensions of the images having a number of pixel values!
Then SVM is used for classification by finding the best estimator by hyperparameter tuning.

Language Used: Python
#Libraries used:
1. Numpy
2. Pandas
3. Matplotlib
4. Sklearn
5. SVC (Support vector Machine)
6. PCA (Principle Component Analysis)

# Data set 
Olliveti faces from kaggle
